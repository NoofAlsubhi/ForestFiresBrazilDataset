# Forest Fires Brazil Dataset ðŸŒ³
### Overview
The impacts of global warming are making the earth hotter and drier. The destruction produced by forest fires exacerbates. These catastrophes generate a variety of issues, not just environmental, but also economic, and pose a significant risk to human life. A better understanding of forest fire frequency can help you prevent them in the future.

In this exploratory data analysis, I'll explore the forest fires in Brazil, focusing on analyzing yearly, monthly, state, and date occurrences of fires.
I will analyse their frequency, location and other parameters where increment or decrement.
I will work on different columns to get good insights from dataset. Also I will find out insights with the help of different graphs.

Working on the following Datset : [kaggle]([/kaggle/input/forest-fires-in-brazil/amazon.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gustavomodelli/forest-fires-in-brazil/data))

### Conclusions
So,far I had perform lots of operations over the dataset to extract  some very useful information from it. If, I have to conclude the dataset in few lines, then I can say that:
* The maximum number of fires were reported in July. 
* In 2003 the maximum number of fires were reported.
* Mato Grosso has the highest number of fires among all states, followed by ParaÃ­ba and SÃ£o Paulo.
* 30650.129 number of fires were reported in Amazonas state.
